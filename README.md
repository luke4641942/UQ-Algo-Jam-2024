# UQ-Algo-Jam-2024

These algorithms were part of my submission for the 2024 UQ Algo-Jam hosted by the UQ Fintech Club and sponsored by IMC trading. We were given 9 implements to trade, with a maximum daily spend of $500K and a years worth of data for each implement to develop and test our algorithms against. Our algorithms would then be tested against the new data where the team with the highest profit would win the competition. While this was my first time coding algorithms to trade different markets and being a solo team, I really enjoyed the competition and came away with a 5th place in a tight finish. My resulting profit from my test data and the new data was largely the same and while i learnt alot of new things in the process, thinking back on it, theres alot of room for improvement with my soltion.
